# UWUVCI-AIO

All in One Version of my Tool UWUVCI

Consoles that you can inject:
* NDS
* N64
* GBA
* NES
* SNES

Features:
* Saving of BaseRoms to only download them once (Downloading currently requires Java!)
* Saving of the CommonKey and the TitleKeys that users only need to enter them once
* Multilanguage support (currently english and an unfinished german translation)
* Dark theme
* Easy to use GUI

Planned Features:
* Removal of the Java Dependency (Currently with the help of Morilli we removed almost every dependency except Java, and thats cause of JNUSTool)
* Downloading of BootImages for Injects and Configuration Files for N64
